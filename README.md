Acitivities developed during my undergraduation at University of SÃ£o Paulo (2020 - present).

This repository is divided by each Semester, and each semester is divided by each programming discipline taken. This repository looks forward to help freshman students that may encounter similar programs in their classes or just want to take a look and analise a little bit more of the programming logic used.
