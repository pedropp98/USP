## About
This repository contains codes developed in classes during my undergraduation at University of São Paulo, Brazil (2020-present). It looks forward to help mostly students and people that are learning to program if they ever encounter a similar problem to the ones presented here or just want to take a look at how I solved this problems.

## How it works
This repository is divided in directories, each directory represents a semester, and each semester contains programming disciplines that I took.

Before you clone this repository, be sure you have installed [Git](https://git-scm.com) and that you have a nice text editor, I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

So, after you make sure you have everything you need:

```bash
#Clone this repository
$git clone https://github.com/pedrousp/USP

#Access the main directory
$cd USP
```

After this, you'll have access to every code in this repository.
