## About

This repository is divided by each Semester, and each semester is divided by each programming discipline taken. This repository looks forward to help students that may encounter similar programs in their classes or just want to take a look and analise a little bit more of my own programming logic.
Any problem, question or mistake I may have done here, feel free to contact me.
